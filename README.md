# Design-of-a-fixed-wing-Tailless-delta-wing-UAV
This project focuses on the design and analysis of a fixed-wing tailless delta-wing UAV for efficient low-speed flight. Aerodynamic analysis was performed using XFLR5, airfoil selection was optimized, and the complete UAV was modeled in Fusion 360 with validation through ANSYS simulations.
